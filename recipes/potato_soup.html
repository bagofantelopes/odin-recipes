    <h1>Bacon Potato Soup</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is an incredibly decadent meal. Don't eat this if you care about health, okay? But oh my goodness is it delicious. You'll need a slow cooker, or at least a large stew pot, to do this properly.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>At least one pack of bacon. You could use more, but that seems excessive to me. You do you though!</li>
            <li>About 5-10 potatos, depending on their size. You can use whatever kind of potato you want, but russet or golden tend to work best for me.</li>
            <li>1 or 2 large onions, depending on how much you like onion.</li>
            <li>Fresh garlic to your preference. I usually use at least half a bulb's worth.</li>
            <li>One block of creamcheese. You can use creamcheese or the low fat variant, neufchattel.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>2 16oz cans of cream of chicken. You could also use cream of mushroom.</li>
            <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese.</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>Optional Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 diced carrots.</li>
            <li>1 diced bell pepper.</li>
            <li>2 cups diced mushrooms.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice up all the vegetables and combine them in your slow cooker. The potatos are best as larger chunks, but dice the rest. Save at least half your allotted garlic and don't chop it up until the end.</li>
            <li>Add seasonings, broth, and cream of chicken.</li>
            <li>Cook on low for at least three hours, more if you have time.</li>
            <li>Towards the end of the prior cooking time, cook the bacon in a skillet.</li>
            <li>When the bacon has cooled, chop/crumble it up into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Chop your remaining garlic then add it, the bacon, and the cream cheese to the soup. Stir until the creamcheese has fully combined with the mixture. Then, continue cooking on low for another hour.</li>
            <li>Once it has finished cooking, add the cheddar cheese. Serve immediately. Garnish with fresh scallions, parsely, or anything else if you want to be fancy.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You can completely opt out of the cheese and creamcheese if you'd prefer. You could use heavy cream to thicken it instead, or just not have any dairy at all. It will still be quite delicious.</li>
            <li>You could add just about anything to the base ingredients and it will be great. Feel free to substitute the bacon with some shredded chicken if you'd prefer it to be sligthly healthier</li>
            <li>Sour cream is another good addition at the end if you just can't get enough dairy. This is essentially a loaded baked potato soup, so go nuts.</li>
            <li>You can do the same recipe in a pressure cooker in under an hour. It will probably not turn out as well, but it definitely works.</li>
